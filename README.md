# This project serves a web page where you can list the movies of an actor sorted by rating.

It is written using Revel, a high-productivity web framework for the [Go language](http://www.golang.org/).

### To use this, you have to get an API key from [The Movie Database](https://themoviedb.org), and save it in a file called 'apiKey' in the movies-of folder.

### Install Revel: 
    
    go get github.com/revel/revel
    go get github.com/revel/cmd/revel


### Start the web server:

   revel run movies-of

### Go to http://localhost:9000/
