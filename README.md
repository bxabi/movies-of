# This project serves a web page where you can list the movies of an actor sorted by rating.

## Try it out live at [https://movies-of.bxabi.com](https://movies-of.bxabi.com)

It is written using Revel, a high-productivity web framework for the [Go language](http://www.golang.org/).

### To use it, you have to get an API key from [The Movie Database](https://themoviedb.org), and save it in a file called 'apiKey' in this folder.

### Clone the repo

    git clone https://github.com/bxabi/movies-of.git

### Start the web server:

    cd movies-of
    go run .

### Go to http://localhost:9000/

## Note:

the project was first made using revel, but the framework became unsupported and unnecessary, so I simplified it to the current state.
